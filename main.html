	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science and algorithm analysis that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of computational time or resources an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the problem's size. Time complexity is often expressed using big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)), which provides an upper bound on how the algorithm's runtime scales with input size. It is very efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity, a concept in computer science and algorithm analysis, refers to the amount of computer memory or space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the problem's size. It evaluates how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources, and it is typically expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), to describe the algorithm's maximum memory usage as the problem size increases.

When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, as the input size (n) increases, the memory used by the algorithm also increases linearly. This is a common space complexity scenario, and it signifies that the algorithm stores data or variables directly proportional to the input size.</b></p>
